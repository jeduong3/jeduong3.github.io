    <h1> Jennifer's Final Project - Clap Night Lamp </h1>
    <div class="header">

    </div>

    <h2> Concept </h2>
    <br>
    <p> This project is a clap-activated smart lamp that 
        responds to claps to control its brightness. The lamp 
        is designed to provide convenient, hands-free lighting control, 
        making it useful for turning off your lights for sleep without
        having to get out of bed.  </p>


    <br>
    <p> The brightness levels follow a sequential pattern </p>
    <br>

    <p> First clap: Turns the lamp ON at full brightness </p>
    <br>
    <p> Second clap: Dims the brightness </p>
    <br>
    <p> Third clap: Further dims the brightness</p>
    <br>
    <p> Fourth clap: Turns the lamp OFF</p>

    <br>
    <h2> Technical Implementation </h2>
    <br>
    <p> The main key components of the lamp uses an Arduino, a MOSFET transistor, a sound sensor module, 
        and a 12V LED strips to achieve the clap activated brightness control. </p>
        <br>
        <p> The Arduino is powered by a 9V battery. The LED strips require a higher voltage and was powered separately by a 12V power supply. 
            The sound sensor module was used to detect loud claps and then it sent a digital signal to the Arduino.
            The Arduino then processes the sensor's input and cycles through the four brightness levels with each detected clap. The MOSFET transistor 
            was used as an electronic switch to control the LED brightness. The Arduino sends PWM signals to adjust the brightness levels accordingly. 
            The Serial Monitor was also used to observe sensor readings and adjust the noise sensitivity threshold to
            ensure the lamp accurately detects claps. </p>

        <br>
    <h2> How it was built into a lamp: </h2>
    <br>
    <p> To create the lamp structure, the LED strips were taped inside a big round plastic container to distribute light evenly
        and hold the lamp structure. Paper was then used to tape around the outside of the clear plastic container to create a 
        soft lighting effect and hide the LED strip lights that are beneath. Cardboard was used for additional structural support 
        and hiding the breadboard and circuits on the base of the lamp. The circuit also included alligator clips and wires, which 
        were routed through the base to top and hidden to maintain the lamp appearance. </p>

        <br>
      <h2> Circuit </h2>
      <p> This was how I built my circuit. </p>
      <br>
        <img src="clapcircuit.png" />
        <br>
      <p> The circuit picture was taken before finalizing the product and assembling everything. 
        I realized I forgot to capture an image of the circuit before putting the lamp together. 
        The only difference between the circuit shown above and my schematic is the connection of the 
        sound sensor module. In the circuit image, the sensor is connected to analog pin A0, but I 
        actually used digital pin 2 instead, as it provided a more responsive and reliable response. The schematic below accurately 
        reflects this change, showing the sensor connected to digital pin 2.
      </p>


      <br>
      <h2> Schematic </h2>
      <img src="clapschem.png" />
      <p> As mentioned earlier, my schematic shows the sound sensor module connected to pin 2,
         which is the configuration I used to operate the lamp. </p>
      
         <br>

      <h2> Firmware Code </h2>
      <p> Below is the firmware code to run my circuit: </p>
      <pre><code>
int soundSensor = 2; // sound sensor connected to pin 2
int LED = 11; // mosfet connected to pin 11 

// 0 = off
// 1 = full brightness
// 2 = dimmed
// 3 = dimmed more
int brightnessLevel = 0; // start brightness at 0

unsigned long lastTriggerTime = 0; // stores the timestamp (in milliseconds) of the last detected clap
const int debounceDelay = 250;  // ignore claps within 250ms to prevent flickering

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(soundSensor, INPUT); //  sound sensor input 
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // led output 
    analogWrite(LED, 0); // LED strip starts OFF
}

void loop() {
    static int lastSensorState = LOW;  // stores previous sensor state
    int sensorData = digitalRead(soundSensor); // read raw sensor data
    unsigned long currentTime = millis(); // store current time

    // detects a new clap (from low to high) and apply debounce to prevent flickering of claps within 250ms
    if (sensorData == HIGH && lastSensorState == LOW && (currentTime - lastTriggerTime > debounceDelay)) { 
        lastTriggerTime = currentTime; // update last detected clap timestamp

        // cycle through brightness levels
        // brightnessLevel + 1 increases the brightness level by 1 each time a clap is detected
        // % 3 (modulus operator) ensures the value always stays within 0, 1, 2, 3 and then loops back to 0
        brightnessLevel = (brightnessLevel + 1) % 4;

        if (brightnessLevel == 1) { // first clap is ON at full brightness
            analogWrite(LED, 255);
            Serial.println("Full Brightness");
        } else if (brightnessLevel == 2) { // second clap is dimmed by 100
            analogWrite(LED, 155);
            Serial.println("Strip dimmed 1");
        } else if (brightnessLevel == 3) { // third clap is dimmed even further by 100 
            analogWrite(LED, 55);
            Serial.println("Strip dimmed 2");
        } else if (brightnessLevel == 0) { // fourth clap is OFF
            analogWrite(LED, 0);
            Serial.println("LED off");
        }
    }

    lastSensorState = sensorData;  // store last sensor state
}
 
      </code></pre>

      <p> The firmware code listens for clap inputs from the sound sensor and cycles through four brightness 
        levels using PWM signals. A debounce mechanism was also used to prevent false triggers from background noise or echos from claps. 
        The brightness increments with each clap and resets after the fourth clap.</p>

        <br>
      <h2> Circuit in Action </h2>
      <p> Video of circuit in action: </p>
      <br>
      <img src="clap.gif" width="600" />
      <br>
      <p> On the first clap, the lights turn on at full brightness (at 255). On the second clap,
        the lights dim (at 155). On the third clap, the lights dim even further (at 55). And lastly, 
        on the fourth clap, the lights turn completely off (at 0). This cycle will repeat for the four claps. 
      </p>
