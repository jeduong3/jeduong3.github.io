    <h1> Jennifer's Assignment 2</h1>
    <div class="header">

      <h2> Schematics </h2>
      <p>I began my assignment by first drawing out schematics before 
      starting on my circuit. </p>
      <img src="fadeSchematic.png" />
      <p><em> The green light was pinned to 9, the blue lights were pinned to 6,
              and the button was pinned to 4. The Arduino operates on a 5V power supply,
              so I used this as my starting point to start my calculations. 
      </em></p>
      <img src="current.png" />
      <p> Since I have two blue LEDs in parallel, each LED receives half of the total 
          current flowing through the resistor. If my total desire current is 40mA, 
          and I used a 100 ohm resistor, then my current is limited to 15 mA. This is
          a safe choice that keeps the current below the maximum 20 mA rating per LED.
          I chose a 220 ohm resistor for my green LED because that would limit my current to 
          15.25 mA. This also safely protects the LED from overcurrent. I used a 10k resistor for
          but button because it provides a good balance between power consumption and noise immunity.
          Lower resistance would draw more current unnecessarily while higher resistance might be 
          less effective in ensuring stable logic levels.</p>
      <h2> Circuit </h2>
      <p> This was how I built my circuit with 1 constantly fading light, and two other lights 
          being controlled by a button, also showing a fading pattern when button is remained pressed. </p>
        <img src="fadeCircuit.png" />
      <p><em> Like mentioned above, the resistors I chose for the circuit were 100 ohms for 
              the blue LEDs, 220 ohms for the green LED, and 10k for the button. 
              If the resistor value was too low, the LEDs could draw too much current and 
              potentially burn out. A higher resistance would result in dimmer LEDs. </em></p>

      <h2> Firmware Code </h2>
      <p> Below is the code I created to run my circuit: </p>
      <pre><code>
        // Pin connection numbers
        const int greenLEDPin = 9;   // Pin connected to Green LED 
        const int blueLEDPins = 6; // Pin connected to Blue LEDS
        const int buttonPin = 4;   // Pin connected to Button
        
        // Variables for fading
        int fadeValue = 0;  // Initial brightness of LED
        int fadeAmount = 5; // Change in brightness for fading
        
        void setup() {
          pinMode(greenLEDPin, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(blueLEDPins, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); 
        }
        
        void loop() {
          if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW) {  // Button is pressed
            // Fade in and out the blue LEDs
            for (int fadeValue = 0; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue += fadeAmount) {
              analogWrite(blueLEDPins, fadeValue); // Brighten Blue LEDs
              analogWrite(greenLEDPin, 255);         // Keep Green LED at full brightness
              delay(30);                          // Delay for fading effect
            }
        
            for (int fadeValue = 255; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -= fadeAmount) {
              analogWrite(blueLEDPins, fadeValue); // Dim Blue LEDs
              analogWrite(greenLEDPin, 255);         // Keep Green LED at full brightness
              delay(30);                          // Delay for fading effect
            }
          } else {  // when button is not pressed
            // Fade in and out the red LED
            for (int fadeValue = 0; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue += fadeAmount) {
              analogWrite(greenLEDPin, fadeValue);   // Brighten Green LED
              digitalWrite(blueLEDPins, LOW);      // Off Blue LEDs
              delay(30);                           // Delay for fading effect
            }
        
            for (int fadeValue = 255; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -= fadeAmount) {
              analogWrite(greenLEDPin, fadeValue);   // Dim Green LED
              digitalWrite(blueLEDPins, LOW);      // Off Blue LEDs
              delay(30);                           // Delay for fading effect
            }
          }
        }

      <h2> Circuit in Action </h2>
      <p> Here is a video of my circuit in action: </p>
      <img src="fadeCircuit.gif" width="600" />
      <p><em> The green light is fading in and out, and when the button is pressed, 
              and remains pressed, the blue lights begin fading in and out.
      </em></p>

      <h2> Additional Questions </h2>
      <p> (1) Graph of LEDs </p>
      <img src="fadeGraph.png" />
      <p> (2) Given my schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only 
        thing that draws current is your LEDs, my circuit would run 
        for approximately 40 hours if powered by a 1200 mAh battery.
