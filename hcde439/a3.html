      <h2> Schematics </h2>
      <p>I began my assignment by first drawing out schematics before 
      starting on my circuit. </p>

      <p><em> The resistance of LDR decreases as light intensity increases.
        In bright light, the LDR resistance drops and in dim light, the LDR
        resistance increases making the voltage closer to 5V. 
        I chose to use a 10k resistor for the photo resistor (LDR) 
        because it is a safe resistor that can ensure the analog values are readable,
        and would balance appropiately for the sensitivity for detecting light. 
        I chose 220 resistors for each of my green LEDs because given that the voltage drop 
        of the color green is 1.6V, and the current flow is 0.02A, I calculated the resistance
        for the 20mA current to be 170 ohms. Therefore, I used 220 ohm resistors so that it is safel
        and so that the LED won't burn out. 
      </em></p>

      <h2> Circuit </h2>
      <p> This was how I built my circuit: </p>
        <img src="sensorCircuit.png" />
      <p><em> As shown in the circuit, 220 ohm resistors were used for each of the 
        green LEDS, and a 10k resistor was used for the LDR. This
        ensured that the output voltage would stay in within the Arduino's analog 
        input range of 0-5V. LED1, the left green LED, is
        connected to pin 9, and the other green light is connected to pin 10. </em></p>

      <h2> Firmware Code </h2>
      <p> Below is the code I created to run my circuit: </p>
      <pre><code>
        const int LED1 = 9; // LED1 pin number
        const int LED2 = 10; // LED2 pin number
        
        void setup() {
          Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial
          pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT); // Set LED1 pin as OUTPUT
          pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT); // Set LED2 pin as OUTPUT
        }
        
        void loop() {
          // Read analog value from sensor
          int sensorVal = analogRead(A0);
        
          // Print sensor value
          Serial.print("Original sensor value: ");
          Serial.println(sensorVal);
        
          // If the sensor value is low (finger on the sensor), 
          // LEDs will be ON (note: sensorvalue is around 850 when lights are off) 
          if (sensorVal < 850) {
            // Map sensor value from the current range of value [850, 930] 
            // to the desired range [255, 0] (high to low brightness)
            int mappedVal = map(sensorVal, 850, 930, 255, 0);
            
            // Write mapped value to both LEDs
            analogWrite(LED1, mappedVal); // Control LED1 brightness
            analogWrite(LED2, mappedVal); // Control LED2 brightness
        
            // Print mapped value 
            Serial.print("Mapped value (LED brightness): ");
            Serial.println(mappedVal);
        
          } else {
            // If the sensor value is greater than 150 (finger is off the sensor)
            // turn off the LEDs
            analogWrite(LED1, 0); // Turn off LED1
            analogWrite(LED2, 0); // Turn off LED2
          }
        
          // Adding small delay for readability 
          delay(100);
        }        

      </code></pre>
      <p><em> Based on my serial monitoring outputs, the sensor value is higher and
        had a value of 924 when bright. Therefore, I mapped 930 closer to the value of 0 so that 
        the lights will be off when it is bright. 
        When it was dim around the sensor, the sensor value was lower and ranged 
        from 840-850. Therefore, I mapped 850 to the value of 255 so that the lights will 
        turn on to full brightness when it is dim around the sensor. 

      <h2> Circuit in Action </h2>
      <p> Here is a video of my circuit in action: </p>
      <img src="sensorCircuit.gif" width="600" />
      <p><em> When it is bright, the lights are off. When it is dim, the lights turn on. 
      </em></p>

      <h2> Additional Questions </h2>
      <p> (1) The variable resistor can be either R1 or R2. </p>
      <img src="senseQ1.png" />
      <p> (2)  </p>
      <img src="sensGraph.png" />
      <p> (3) If we had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead,
            the output range from the 10-bit PWM is now 0 to 1023. If we had a 16-bit ADC, 
           the sensor value would range from 0 to 65535. I would change my mapping to 
           int mappedVal = map(sensorVal, 0, 65535, 1023, 0). The sensor values would 
           range from 0 to 65535 because of the 16-bit ADC, and the PWM values are mapped to a 10-bit range, 
           so they will go from 0 to 1023. </p>
